    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python to analyze the [pointwise mutual information (PMI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) of tokens in the text of Shakespeare's plays.    For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) that you used for Assignment 0.   You will also need the Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two events $x$ and $y$ are independent, their PMI will be zero.   A positive PMI indicates that $x$ and $y$ are more likely to co-occur than they would be if they were independent.   Similarly, a negative PMI indicates that $x$ and $y$ are less likely to co-occur.   The PMI of events $x$ and $y$ is given by\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "PMI(x,y) = \\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the probabilities of occurrence of events $x$ and $y$, and $p(x,y)$ is the probability of co-occurrence of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, the \"events\" that we are interested in are occurrences of tokens on lines of text in the input file.   For example, one event\n",
    "might represent the occurence of the token \"fire\" a line of text, and another might represent the occurrence of the token \"peace\".   In that case, $p(fire)$ represents the probability that \"fire\" will occur on a line of text, and $p(fire,peace)$ represents the probability that *both* \"fire\" and \"peace\" will occur on the *same* line.   For the purposes of these PMI computations, it does not matter how many times a given token occures on a single line.   Either a line contains a particular token (at least once), or it does not.   For example, consider this line of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> three three three, said thrice\n",
    "\n",
    "For this line, the following token-pair events have occurred:\n",
    "- (three, said)\n",
    "- (three, thrice)\n",
    "- (said, three)\n",
    "- (said, thrice)\n",
    "- (thrice, three)\n",
    "- (thrice, said)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are not interested in \"reflexive\" pairs, such as (thrice,thrice).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the probabilities of events, we will also be interested in the absolute *number* of occurences of particular events, e.g., the number of lines in which \"fire\" occurs.   We will use $n(x)$ to represent the these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task for this assignment is to write Python code to analyze the PMI of tokens from Shakespeare's plays.    Based this analysis, we want to be able to answer two types of queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two-Token Queries: Given a pair of tokens, $x$ and $y$, report the number of lines on which that pair co-occurs ($n(x,y)$) as well as $PMI(x,y)$.\n",
    "* One-Token Queries: Given a single token, $x$, report the number of lines on which that token occurs ($n(x)$).   In addition, report the five tokens that have the largest PMI with respect to $x$ (and their PMIs).   That is, report the five $y$'s for which $PMI(x,y)$ is largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid reporting spurious results for the one-token queries, we are only interested in token pairs that co-occur a sufficient number of times.   Therefore, we will use a *threshold* parameter for one-token queries.   A one-token query should only report pairs of tokens that co-occur at least *threshold* times in the input.   For example, given the threshold 12, a one-token query for \"fire\" the should report the five tokens that have the largest PMI (with respect to \"fire\") among all tokens that co-occur with \"fire\" on at least 12 lines.   If there are fewer than five such tokens, report fewer than five.\n",
