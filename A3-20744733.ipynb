    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
    "For example, this line:\n",
    "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know from the previous assignment, you must tell the Python interpreter where to find Spark before performing any Spark operations in your program.   So, start by doing that:"

    "\n",
    "To get warmed up, you should first write Spark code to confirm or determine some basic properties of the Gnutella graph.  Write code that will display answers to the following questions:\n",
    "- How many nodes and edges are there in the graph?  (This should confirm the numbers given above.)\n",
    "- How many edges of each outdegree are there?   That is, how many nodes have no outgoing edges, how many have one outgoing edge, how many have two outgoing edges, and so on?\n",
    "- How many edges of each indegree are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use Spark to answer these questions.   Do *not* load the entire graph into your Python driver program.   It is OK to use a separate set of Spark operations to answer each question."

Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Spark provides the ability to *cache* RDDs.   This is useful when an RDD will be used more than once.   Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, go back to the code that you wrote to answer Question 3, and add caching.   (Caching will not affect the functionality of your code, i.e., what it computes.   It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adding `cache()` calls in your code, use the text cell below to briefly explain how you decided which RDDs to cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were not able to finish Question 3, add caching annotations to your solution for Question 2 instead."

    "*Actually I have add the cache function in the above code which allow me to get the result much more faster. After I give partitions to the `graph` I use `persist()` to keep it in the memory which can be also replaced by `cache`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since later in the iteration stage, the RDD `graph` is keeping being used during the computation of the sum of the contributions and the final modified personalized page rank. Otherwise, every time, for example, when I update the rank for purpose of the random jumping and the dangling points, the driver needs to load the data again and process the previous work which will waste quite a bit resource and time. Besides, keep the partitions unchanged in cache will be helpful for the `join()` function since it is no need to shuffle the graph part whose hash of keys have been saved in memory*\n",
