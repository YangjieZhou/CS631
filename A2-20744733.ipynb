For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) and Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`, that you used for the first two assignments.    You will also use the same definition of PMI that was used for [Assignment 1](https://lintool.github.io/bigdata-2018w/assignment1-431.html).\n",

    "To use Spark from within a Python program, it is first necessary to tell the Python interpreter where the Spark installation is located.   You will be using the Spark installation in the CS451 course account.   The code in the following cell tells Python how to find this Spark installation.   Before going on, execute that code (by selecting the cell and hitting 'return' while holding down the shift key).   It will take a few seconds to run, and will produce no output."

The `master` parameter indicates that Spark jobs will run in local mode, using two threads.   This means that your Spark jobs are not really running on a cluster (since we do not have a Spark cluster in the CS student computing environment), and are instead running in a single process on the local machine.   You program Spark jobs the same way whether they run in local mode or on a cluster - the main difference between local and cluster modes is, of course, performance.\n",

    "Finally, write Spark code that will prompt the user for two inputs: a positive integer threshold $T$, and a sample size $N$.   For every token $x$ in `Shakespeare.txt`, your code should find all tokens $y$ that co-occur with $x$ at least $T$ times, as well as PMI$(x,y)$ for each such pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $x$, the output of your program should be similar to the output that would be produced by a One-Token query on $x$ (see Assignment 1), with threshold $T$ - except that here you report all co-occuring tokens above the threshold, rather than just five.   Rather than producing output for all possible tokens $x$, your program should produce output only for $N$ different $x$'s, chosen *at random* from among all distinct tokens in the input file.\n"
